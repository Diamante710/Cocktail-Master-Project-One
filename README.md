# <Cocktails-to-Flock-your-Tail>

## Description
This app is designed to help anyone create the perfect cocktail. Simply select your alcohol of choice from the drop-down menu and a list of custom curated cocktails will appear. The cards will have the name on the back plus ingredients and directions for crafting the perfect drink! As an added bonus, the app also includes dad jokes to go along with the drinks so that you can impress friends and family with delicious concoctions as well as charm them with hilarious jokes!

## User Story
AS an introverted software developer aspiring to be a comedian,
I WANT to be able to quickly get my guest tipsy, by serving tasty drink concoctions,
SO THAT I can make people laugh by telling dad jokes.
